# Use the assignment operator =  to assign values to variables

# Use basic arithmetic operators with variables to create expressions

# Use explicit conversion to change a data type from float to string

# The following lines assign the variable to the left of the = 
# assignment operator with the values and arithmetic expressions 
# on the right side of the = assignment operator.
hotel_room = 100
tax = hotel_room * 0.08
total = hotel_room + tax
room_guests = 4

# Output multiple string variables on a single line to form a sentence

# Use the plus (+) connector or a comma to connect strings in a print() function

# Create spaces between variables in  a print() function

# The following 5 lines assign strings to a list of variables.
salutation = "Dr."
first_name = "Prisha"
middle_name = "Jai"
last_name = "Agarwal"
suffix = "Ph.D."
 
print(salutation + " " + first_name + " " + middle_name + " " + last_name + ", " + suffix) 
# The comma as a string ", " adds the conventional use of a comma plus a 
# space to separate the last name from the suffix.
 
# Alternatively, you could use commas in place of the + connector:
print(salutation, first_name, middle_name, last_name,",", suffix)
# However, you will find that this produces a space before a comma within a string.


# Resolve TypeError caused by a data type mismatch issue

# Use an explicit conversion function

print("5 * 3 = " + str(5*3)) 
 
# Resolution: 
# print("5 * 3 = " + str(5*3))
#
# To avoid a type error between the string and the integer within the
# print() function, you can make an explicit data type conversion by
# using the str() function to convert the integer to a string.  

# Resolve a ZeroDivisionError caused by an attempt to divide by 0

numerator = 7
denominator = 2   # Possible resolution: Change the denominator value 
result = numerator / denominator
print(result)
 
# One possible assumption for a number divided by zero error might
# include the issue of a null value as a denominator (could happen when
# using a loop to iterate over values in a database). In such cases, the
# desired outcome may be to leave the numerator value intact. The
# numerator value can be preserved by reassigning the denominator with 
# the integer value of 1. The result would then equal the numerator.


##Function

# Use a function that accepts multiple parameters

# Return a result value

# This function calculates the number of days in a variable number of 
# years, months, and days. These variables are provided by the user and
# are passed to the function through the functionâ€™s parameters.
def find_total_days(years, months, days):
# Assign a variable to hold the calculations for the number of days in
# a year (years*365) plus the number of days in a month (months*30) plus
# the number of days provided through the "days" parameter variable.
    my_days = (years*365) + (months*30) + days
# Use the "return" keyword to send the result of the "my_days"  
# calculation to the function call. 
    return my_days
 
# Function call with user provided parameter values. 
print(find_total_days(2,5,23))


# Use a function to return the result of a measurement conversion

# Use arithmetic operators to perform a calculation

# Combine text with a function call within a print() statement

# Convert the return value from a float data type to a string for the print() function

# Call the function and perform a calculation on the return value within a print() statement

# This function converts fluid ounces to milliliters and returns the 
# result of the conversion.
def convert_volume(fluid_ounce):
# Calculate value of the "ml" variable using the parameter variable 
# "fluid_ounce". There are approximately 29.5 milliliters in 1 fluid
# ounce.
    ml = fluid_ounce * 29.5  
# Return the result of the calculation.  
    return ml
 
# Call the conversion from within the print() function using 2 fluid 
# ounces. Convert the return value from a float to a string.  
print("The volume in millimeters is " + str(convert_volume(2)))
 
# Call the function again and double the 2 fluid ounces from within
# the print function.
print("The volume in millimeters is " + str(convert_volume(2)*2))
# Alternative calculation:
# print("The volume in millimeters is " + str(convert_volume(4))

##Operators

# To check if two values are the same, use the equality operator: == 

# To check if two values are not the same, use the not equal to operator: != 


print(32 == 30+2)   # The == operator checks if the 2 values are 
True                # equal to each other. If they are equal, 
                    # Python returns a True result.


print(5+10 == 6+7)  # If the two values are not equal, as in the
False               # expression 5+10 == 6+7 (or 15 == 13), Python          
                    # returns a False result.


print(10-4 != 10+4) # The != operator checks if the 2 values are
True                # NOT equal to each other. If true, Python              
                    # returns a True result. 


print(9/3 != 3*1)   # In this last example, 9/3 != 3*1 (or 3 != 3)
False               # is false. So, Python returns a False value.

# The equality == operator versus the equals = operator 


# The = equals assignment operator is used to assign a value to a 
# variable.

my_variable = 3*5           # Assigns a value to my_variable      
print(my_variable)          # Printing the variable returns the 
15                          # value assigned to the variable.


                              
# The == equality comparison operator checks if the values of the two
# expressions on either side of the == operator are equivalent to one 
# another.
      
print(my_variable == 3*5)   # Printing the variable returns a Boolean 
True                        # True or False result. 

# To check if one value is larger than another value, use the greater than operator: > 

# To check if one value is smaller than another value, use the less than operator: < 


print(11 > 3*3)         # The > operator checks if the left value is
True                    # greater than the right value. If true, it
                        # returns a True result.


print(4/2 > 8-4)        # If the > operator finds that the left value
False                   # is NOT greater than the right value, the
                        # comparison will return a False result.


print(4/2 < 8-4)        # The < operator checks  if the left value is
True                    # less than the right side. If true, the
                        # comparison returns a True result.


print(11 < 3*3)         # If the < operator finds that the left side is False                   
                        # NOT less than the right value, Python returns
False                   # a False result.


# To check if one value is larger than or equal to another value, 
# use the greater than or equal to operator: >= 

# To check if one value is smaller than or equal to another value, 
# use the less than or equal to operator: <= 


print(12*2 >= 24)   # The >= operator checks if the left value is
True                # greater than or equal to the right value. 
                    # If one of these conditions is true,  
                    # Python returns a True result. In this case  
                    # the two values are equal. So, the comparison
                    # returns a True result.


print(18/2 >= 15)   # If the >= comparison determines that the left False
False               # value is NOT greater than or equal to the
                    # right, it returns a False result.

print(12*2 <= 30)   # The <= operator checks if the left value is
True                # less than or equal to the right value. In 
                    # this case, the left value is less than the
                    # right value. Again, if one of the two 
                    # conditions is true, Python returns a True
                    # result.


print(15 <= 18/2)   # If the <= comparison determines that the left 
False               # value is NOT less than or equal to the right
                    # value, the comparison returns a False result. 


# Equality == and Not Equal to != Operators with Strings

# The == operator can check if two strings are equal to each other. 
# If they are equal, the Python interpreter returns a True result.
print("a string" == "a string")
True


# In this example, the equality == comparison is between "4 + 5" and
# 4 + 5. Since the left data type is a string and the right data type
# is an integer, the two values cannot be equal. So, the comparison
# returns a False result.
print("4 + 5" == 4 + 5)
False


# The != operator can check if the two strings are NOT equal to each
# other. If they are indeed not equal, then Python returns a True result.
print("rabbit" != "frog")
True


# In this example, the variable event_city has been assigned the string 
# value "Shanghai". This variable is compared to a static string, 
# "Shanghai", using the != operator. As, the strings "Shanghai" and 
# "Shanghai" are the same, the comparison of "Shanghai" != "Shanghai" 
# is false. Accordingly, Python will return a False result.
event_city = "Shanghai"
print(event_city != "Shanghai")
False

# This last example illustrates the result of trying to compare two
# items of different data types using the equality == operator. The
# two items are not equal, so the comparison returns False.
print("three" == 3)
False


# The Greater Than > and Less Than < Operators

# The greater than > operator checks if the left string has a higher 
# Unicode value than the right string. If true, the Python interpreter
# returns a True result. Since W has a Unicode value of 87, and you can 
# easily calculate that F has a Unicode value of 70, this comparison is
# the same as 87 > 70. As this is true, Python will return a True 
# result.
print("Wednesday" > "Friday")
True
 
 
# The less than < operator checks if the left string has a lower 
# Unicode value than the right string. If you reference the Unicode 
# chart above, you can see that all lowercase letters have higher 
# Unicode values than uppercase letters. We can see that B has a 
# Unicode value of 66 and b has a Unicode value of 98. This 
# comparison is the same as 66 < 98, which is true. So, Python will 
# return a True result.
print("Brown" < "brown")
True


# If the strings have the same first few letters, the comparison will 
# cycle through each letter of each string, from left to right until it 
# finds two letters that have different Unicode values. In this example, 
# both strings share the initial substring "sun", but then have 
# different letters with different Unicode values in the fourth place 
# in each string. So, the fourth letters 'b' and 't' of the two
# strings are used for the comparison. Since 'b' does not have a higher
# Unicode value than 't', the comparison returns a False result.
print("sunbathe" > "suntan")
False


# If two identical strings are compared using the less than < comparison
# operator, this will produce a False result because they are equal.
print("Lima" < "Lima")
False


# This last example illustrates the result of trying to compare two
# items of different data types using the less than < operator. The 
# greater than > and less than operators < cannot be used to compare
# two different data types. 
print("Five" < 6)
# '''
# Error on line 1:
#     print("Five" < 6)
# TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'

# The Greater Than or Equal To >= and Less Than or Equal To <= Operators

# Use the Unicode chart in Part 2 to determine if the Unicode values of 
# the first letters of each string are higher, lower, or equal to one
# another.

# Example 1

print((6*3 >= 18) and (9+9 <= 36/2))

# Example 2

print("Nairobi" < "Milan" and "Nairobi" > "Hanoi")

# PART 2: The or Logical Operator

# True or True returns True
print((15/3 < 2+4) or (0 >= 6-7))

# False or True returns True
print(country == "New York City" or city == "New York City")

# PART 3: The not Logical Operator

# Test Example 1:

today = "Monday"
print(not today == "Tuesday") 


# The "today" variable states today is Monday. This makes the comparison

# True."


# Conditionals

# Use a comparison operator with numbers

# Use a comparison operator to alphabetize strings
