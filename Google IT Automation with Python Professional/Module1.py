# Use the print() function to output a string 

# Syntax for printing a string of text
print("I love Python!")


# Syntax for printing numeric values
print(360)
print(32*45)


# Syntax for printing the value of a variable
value = 8*6
print(value)


# Use arithmetic operators, with a focus on exponents

# Multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction
print(3*8/2+5-1)
 
# Exponents
print(4**6) # Syntax means 4 to the power of 6
print(4**2) # To square a number
print(4**3) # To cube a number
print(4**0.5) # To find the square root of a number

# To calculate how many different possible combinations can be
# formed using a set of "x" characters with each character in "x"
# having "y" number of possible values, you will need to use an 
# exponent for the calculation:
x = 4
y = 26
print(y**x)


# Use variables with assignment and arithmetic operators

# Assignment of values to the variables:
years = 10
weeks_in_a_year = 52
# This variable is assigned an arithmetic calculation:
weeks_in_a_decade = years * weeks_in_a_year
# Prints the calculation stored in the "weeks_in_a_decade" variable:
print(weeks_in_a_decade)
