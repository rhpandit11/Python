    "- Use the “multiprocessing” module for parallel processing: The “multiprocessing” module allows you to run multiple processes in parallel, which can speed up your code.\n",
    "- Use “numpy” for numerical computations: The numpy library is highly optimized for numerical computations and can be significantly faster than pure Python code.\n",
