    "Magic Methods in Python\n",
    "In Python, Magic methods in Python are the special methods that start and end with the double underscores\n",
    "\n",
    "- Magic methods are not meant to be invoked directly by you, but the invocation happens internally from the class once certain action is performed\n",
    "- Examples for magic methods are: __new__, __repr__, __init__, __add__, __len__, __del__, etc. The __init__ method - used for initialization is invoked without any call\n",
    "- Use the dir() function to see the number of magic methods inherited by a class\n",
    "- The advantage of using Python’s magic methods is that they provide a simple way to make objects behave like built-in types\n",
    "- Magic methods can be used to emulate the behavior of built-in types of user-defined objects. Therefore, whenever you find yourself trying to manipulate a user-defined object’s output in a Python class, then use magic methods.\n",

    "- A return statement terminates a function entirely but a yield statement pauses the function saving all its states and later continues from there on successive calls.\n",
    "- Generator expressions can be used as function arguments. Just like list comprehensions, generator expressions allow you to quickly create a generator object within minutes with just a few lines of code.\n",

For this reason, compared to list comprehension, a generator expression is much more memory efficient.\n",
